<p>The St. Nicholas Neighborhood Stat team joined forces with the Resident Association President,
Mr. Ball. In partnership, Mr. Ball granted the team access to the Computer Room, located within
building 225 West 129th Street, and has agreed in writing to confirm his partnership with the
stakeholder team. The computer room currently has 15 computers available but lacks current
internet access. We plan to provide an additional 15 laptops and a coding program to the space as
well as free wifi. Because the Resident Association is still in the process of articulating their
budget for the upcoming fiscal year, as per our understanding the current operalization of the
space might be subject to change, and henceforth we are not in a position to provide outdated
information with respects to what particular programs are operating out of the center currently
As per the agreement, The Resident Association member will provide access to the team 3 days
(2 weekday and I weekend) per week from 5:00 PM to 10:00 PM, allowing for the
Neighborhood Stat programming component to roll out. The program will consist of (4) 6-8 week
cohorts which will provide services to up to 60 (15 youth/cohort) young people through an 8-12
month period with the goal of 100% retainment. The first cohort will begin in April of 2019, the
youth applications submitted will be reviewed and the youth will be called in for an interview</p>
